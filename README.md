# transfer-learning
Eye blindness Detection using deep learning pre trained models in keras.
I used VGG-16 to diagnose the different types of diseases in human eye.

Functions-

The Cropping function is used to make the images more lightened and this function will work with any images 
for deep learning models.

At the end i used transfer learning to train the model by using keras pre-trained weights for VGG-16.
The default size of VGG-16 for images is 224*224*3. So i used the same size to trained my images you can also try any other dimension.
